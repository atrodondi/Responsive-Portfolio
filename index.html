          I am an avid rock climber who is trying to find a balance between my
          work life and my constant pursuit of higher climbing. I have worked
          all kinds of jobs in all kinds of places. Most recently I was working
          as a project m anager at a small construction company. Loved who I
          worked for, but the job itself was a bit of the same thing every day
          and I needed a bit more of a challenge.I am an avid rock climber who
